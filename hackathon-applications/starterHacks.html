	<div id="QUESTIONS">
		<h2>Application</h2>
		<h3 id="why">Why attend?</h3>
		<p>
			<strong>Reason 1<br></strong> 
			I attend 30 hours of class each week and I work part-time as Google Search Assessor for Lionbridge Inc., leaving my personal projects and self-education in the conscious/unconscious 2AM-3AM grey zone. 
			A hackathon is a safe haven... a predetermined 24-hour period in which I'll code, create, and "$git push origin master" without work/school pressure creeping up on me.      
			

			<strong><br><br>Reason 2<br></strong> 
			I am (in every sense of the word) a "starter" in software/hardware dev.  While WesternHacks IV and DeltaHacks III pushed me to meet the seemingly Mt. Everest-like standards of seasoned hackers, I see myself in a much more kind and relatable environment at StarterHacks. 
			With that being said, I still have many goals as a CS learner, especially between now and StarterHacks. To me, ambition/initiative is the only way to overcome the "nube" status, and I'm 99.99% sure you'll agree.

		<p>
			Hi! By the way, I'm a photographer (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/ben.m.li">aesthetics</a>), and I'm fascinated by its constituent technologies like computer vision (image processing, facial rec, etc.) and online innovations that support it like Instagram and 500px.<br><br>

			Here's how I'd like to add to that pool of tech:
			One of my major impediments as a photographer used to occur before I walked out the door, and that's the work of professional photographers, who are able to travel to Earth's most aesthetic locations...... personally, live in a random ON suburb; and my lack of access to places like the Swiss Alps and Bora Bora has led me to think I'm incapable of producing amazing photos.<br><br>

			This is untrue. Every city has hidden gems and vistas. Nonetheless, many artists face this psychological barrier, because they aren't aware that they can recreate shots of exotic locations in their own cities. I have a method of addressing this issue and I'd like to bring it to life at StarterHacks.<br><br>

			As an example..... <br>
