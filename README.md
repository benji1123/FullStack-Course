Context: after changing the URL of a previous repo, I could not figure out how to push new commits (I still don't).
In an attempt to overcome this problem, I created a new repo (this one) and attempted to commit my files there...
Still, nothing worked. I stumbled upon a Stack Overflow post, where I learned the power of "push -f", and here we are:

(1) photography-test: my first test page that used HTML, CSS, and Jacascript together. It is a quick intro to who I am and contains one of my favorite photos I took!
(2) a similar test site to (1) that was made based off the HTML Dog begginer tutorial
